# ANFIS_EnergyEfficience

## Introduction

This exercise presents an exploration into the efficiency of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in predicting the heating load of residential buildingsâ€”a key aspect in enhancing energy efficiency.  

Through testing of different ANFIS configurations, we aim to identify optimal parameters that align with the predictive accuracy presented in Tsanas and Xifara's1 paper. By comparing several model iterations and evaluating them based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), we seek to establish a streamlined, yet accurate, ANFIS model for Heat Loss prediction. The exercise encourages a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application, fostering a hands-on approach to learning in the domain of Computational Intelligence.
